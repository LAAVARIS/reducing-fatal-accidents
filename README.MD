# Reducing the number of high fatality accidents

I was working for the road safety team within the department of transport and they were looking into how they can reduce the number of major incidents. The safety team classes major incidents as fatal accidents involving 3+ casualties. They were trying to learn more about the characteristics of these major incidents so they can brainstorm interventions that could lower the number of deaths. They asked for your assistance with answering a number of questions.
